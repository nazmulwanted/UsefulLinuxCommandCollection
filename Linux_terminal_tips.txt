1. Archiving and compressing file-
===================================

Archiving means combining many files to one file.
Compressing means make a file smaller.

Some popular tools for archiving and compressing files are -
zip,tar,gzip,bzip,bzip2 etc.

This tutorial is about archiving and compressing files in Linux system (specially in terminal).

  i) First of all zip command. To zip a file-
      zip <zip file name> <target file>
     For example - to compress a file named wallpaper.png using zip-
      zip wallpaper.zip wallpaper.png
   
     If we want to compress multiple files at once then-
       zip file.zip file1.zip file2.zip file3.zip
     [ Tip: useful command -> ls -lh]
    
    If we want to compress a folder named test then->
      zip -r testFolder.zip test/

    If we want to control the zip amount then use -0 to -9 after zip command.
    If we want to zip a file with password protection on then ->
      zip -e test.zip test.txt
    [-p will show history.Keep that in mind that password encryption in zip is weak!]

    To unzip a file : 
     unzip -l test.zip

    To unzip a file without error->
     unzip -t test.zip

  ii) Using gzip-> super popular tool in linux. Keep that in mind that it deletes the original file
      after archiving and compressing it.
      gzip test.txt
      or gzip -c text.txt > text.txt.gz
      [compress amount supported -- use -0 to -9 to control zip amount.]
      same works for bzip2

  iii) Using tar for archiving only->
        'tar' also works with gzip and bzip2.
        'tar'does not delete the original file after archiving.
        'tar' file is bigger because it needs more info to archive a file.
        tar -cf test.txt.tar test.txt
        or 
        tar -zcvf test.txt.tar.gz test.txt [to tar and gzip a file at once]
        same goes for folder or directory. 
        [-zcvf means gzip creates verbose file.]
        If we want to use bzip instead of gzip then->
          tar -jcvf test.txt.tar.gz test.txt

        To extract tar file->
          tar -zxvf test.txt.tar.gz

2. Man for Manual
==================

  i) to search specific term -> /<searching topic>
     press 'n' for next.
  ii) another search tool in man page->
      man -k <search term>
      or
      man -f <search term>
  iii) keep updated man page about a command->
      man -u <topic>
     topic(some number) means category. total 8 category starting from 1.
     1- system commands category like cd, ssh-agent etc.
     2- low level system commands category like chmod, socket etc.
     3- c library functions strcat etc.
     4- special devices.
     5- file related.
     6- Games category.
     7- miscellaneous.
     8- system like mount , shut down etc.
3. Networking tools Part 1
==========================

  i) ip a 
  ii) ifconfig
  iii) sudo ifconfig eth0 promisc [activate promiscuous mode to sniff data  packets]
       ifconfig
       sudo ifconfig eth0 -promisc [deactivate promiscuous mode]
       ifconfig
  iv) sudo ip link set dev eth0 promisc on
      ip a
      sudo ip link set dev eth0 promisc off 
      ip a
  v) to up/down interface->
     ifconfig eth0 down
     or
     ip link set eth0 down
  vi) ifconfig eth0 add/del <ip_address> [to add or delete ip address to the interface]
      or
      ip a add/del <ip_address>
  vii) routing table:
       route
       or 
       ip route show
  vii) ifconfig -a
       to know config of specific interface e.g eth0 then-
       ifconfig eth0
  viii) iwconfig [to know wireless interface]
  ix) ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 [pings 4 times]
   x) traceroute
   xi) netstat -ie
   xii) host www.google.com [finds out host's ip address.]

4. apt[2014 project] or apt-get:
================================
  Application packaging tool - apt more advanced than apt-get.
  i) sudo apt-cache search firefox [to search firefox related info]
     or use apt
     sudo apt search firefox
  ii) for more information : apt --help, man apt
      and  https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/index.html

5. Working with storage media, iso images, and md5 checksums
=============================================================
  i) mount
  ii) umount <device name>
  iii) to mount a fixed file path-
       mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 my_stuff/ [-t means file type which fat and my mounted storage 
                                           sda1 and folder name my_stuff/]
       then we can browse to folder. if we need to unmount then comeback to home folder and
       then we can unmount the mounted storage.
  iv) to format a storage media - use fdisk.
       sudo fdisk /dev/sda1
        it then goes to a fdisk prompt.
       type 'p' for see partition table.
       type 'q' to quit or 'm' to check for more menus.
  v) to make a new file system-
     sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sda1
 vi) to check filesystem or repair filesystem -
     sudo fsck /dev/sda1
 vii) to check md5 sum of a file-
      md5sum file.iso 
6. Package Management
======================
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install <package or application name>
  sudo apt upgrade
  sudo apt-cache search <package name> or apt search <package name>
  sudo dpkg -i package.deb [using dpkg to install a package of deb format]
  sudo apt install -f [forcefully install dependencies]
   to remove-
     sudo apt remove <package name>
   to see lists of installed packages- 
     dpkg --list
     to show status of a package-
     dpkg --status <package name>
     apt-cache show <package name>
     dpkg --search <package name>
7. Customizing shell prompt
==============================


 echo $PS1 [to show user and computer name]

 original_backup="$PS1" [to back up original command prompt]

 PS1= [to show nothing in command prompt]

 PS1="\$" [to show '$' sign only]

 PS1="\[\033[0;35m\]\u@\h:\w$ " [color change]

 PS1="\[\033[1;35m\]\u@\[\033[1;36m\]\h:\[\033[1;32m\]\w\[\033[1;37m\]$ " [color change]

 End the line with \[\033[0m\] to make it a black background again

 Save your new lines to the bashrc file as: PS1="\[\033[1;35m\]\u@\[\033[1;36m\]\h:\[\033[1;32m\]\w\[\033[1;37m\]$ "

 export PS1

8. Familiar with Vi
====================

  improved version of Vi is Vim which means Vi improved.
  to enter into vim or vi type - vi
  to quit type ->  :q or :q!
  there is two mode - first is command mode which writes commands and another is normal mode
  which is keyboard output to file.
  to write into a file for example - example.txt->
  vi example.txt
  then press 'i' to enter into insert mode and then type whatever you like.
  to save it first press 'esc' to enter into command mode and then type ':w'
